# Hints and Tips :tada:

1. The _TLDR_ of this application is that we're creating a management command line application, we can view, add and delete employees from a database in MySQL.

1. We've been given the schema for the database which is a blueprint for the tables that we need to construct.

1. We've been given the packages that we need to work with in order to do our functionality - console.table looks like it will be extremely useful for us!

1. Utilise the seed.sql when you've setup your database, it's going to be a lot easier to work with your app in javascript if you can log out the data coming back, rather than having to make it all each time you use the application!

1. All of the bonus criteria is required!
   - You can update employee managers in the app
   - View employees by their manager
   - Delete departments
   - Delete roles
   - Delete employees
   - Application allows users to view the utilised budget for a department

# Submission Checklist :rocket:

1. Ensure that you submit both a link to your homework repo and a video of your application working!

   > Check for sneaky console errors and leftover console logs!

1. Ensure what you've submitted works when you grade it yourself against the:

   - The user stories provided
   - The acceptance criteria's provided.

1. Make sure your homework repo has a quality README that _you_ have written, and provide screenshots **and a github video of your application working!**

   - To do this there's lots of screen capture software available however the standard operating system should work fine:

     1. Mac OS: You should be able to use QuickTime player to screen record.
     1. Windows: You should be able to use a built in Screen Recorder as part of the Windows Game Bar, https://betanews.com/2019/01/14/windows-10-screen-recorder-ultility/

     > If neither of these work then a safe bet is to look at OBS but the UI can be a bit clunky at first :thumbsup:

   - Probably easiest to leave this video in Google Drive and keep it out of Git, especially if it's a massive file!

1. Commit after most changes, all that code doesn't just appear first time :wink:

1. **Comment that JavaScript code :pray:**
